## Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data

This project was about extracting and cleaning the Open Street Map (OSM) data of greater Montreal. The provided OSM data was in JSON and around 300MB in size, it was appropriately reshaped and stored on a local MongoDB server. Then using queries, it looked for badly formatted data and perform the appropriate action towards it. Also, the mix of using both English and French for the data was addressed, and an attempt to standardize all entries to one language was performed with a good result.

Python, MongoDB, RegEx
